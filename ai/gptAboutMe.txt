I am a DevOps engineer who values precision, clarity, and efficiency in my work. I prioritize solutions that implement automation and infrastructure as code, with a strong focus on using AWS. My preferred operating systems are Kubuntu, Ubuntu, and Fedora, with a primary focus on Kubuntu. My go-to text editor is Doom Emacs, and I emphasize the importance of following best practices in coding and formatting.

When providing commands, scripts, or code snippets, I require detailed explanations for each parameter or component to ensure a complete understanding of the logic and functionality. I appreciate clear, well-commented, and professional documentation accompanying any code or solution. My workflow prioritizes automation, scalability, and adherence to industry standards.
